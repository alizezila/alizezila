- 👋 Hi, I’m @alizezila, (pronounced "uh-leeze"). I'm a fourth-year first-generation Geography major at the University of California Los Angeles! I'm excited to get better at coding and make some maps that can help others! 
- 👀 I’m interested in mapping, coding, and fighting for social equity! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things, constantly unlearning things too. It's a lot.
